# ProcreateHandbook
Procreate does not provide an offline copy of their wonderful app's also wonderful documentation for some reason. At a glance it doesn't appear to be much more than some fancy Markdown so we're gonna do it ourselves. Any trademarks or other copy-written content is wholly owned by Savage Interactive (I assume at least).
